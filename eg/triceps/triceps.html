<h2 class="head1">1.Triceps Pushdown</h2>
<p class="para1">Set the cable machine up with the bar at head height. 
Grab the bar and stand upright with your back straight and your elbows 
tucked in to your sides. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, or place 
one in front of the other if it helps you balance. Pull the cable down 
until the bar touches your thighs and pause to squeeze your triceps at 
the bottom of the move. Then slowly raise the bar back to the starting 
position. Make sure you don’t lean forwards to aid the press and don’t 
let your elbows leave your sides, otherwise you’ll lose some of the focus
 on the triceps.</p>

<h2 class="head1">2.Skull Crusher</h2>
<p class="para1">Hold a dumbbell in each hand and lie faceup on an exercise 
mat (or bench) with knees bent and feet flat on the floor.Extend arms above 
the chest with palms facing each other. Engage glutes and pull the rib cage
 down to prevent arching the low back. Tucking elbows in and pressing shoulders down, slowly bend elbows to lower the dumbbells about an inch above the forehead on either side of the head. Avoid moving upper arms and anchor shoulders down to engage the lats, 
isolating the triceps as the weights lower.</p>

<h2 class="head1">3.Reverse Dips</h2>
<p class="para1">Sit on your chair or bench with your arms at your side and
 your feet flat on the floor, hip distance apart.Position your hands so that
 your palms are down beside your hips. Your fingers should grip the front of 
 the chair seat. Move your torso forward off the chair with your arms 
 extended. Your buttocks should hover over the floor and your knees should
 be slightly bent. Your heels should touch the floor a few inches in front 
 of your knees.Breathe in as you slowly lower your body, hinging at the elbows
 until each forms a 90-degree angle.Breathe out as you push up to your 
 starting position with your arms fully extended.</p>
