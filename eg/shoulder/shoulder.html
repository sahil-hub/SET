<h2 class="head1">1.Shoulder Press</h2>
<p class="para1">First, select your dumbbells. Don’t go overboard on the 
weight here, because this is an exercise that suddenly feels very tough 
halfway through a set. You almost want to feel like you’ve picked too light
 a weight for the first couple of reps. Opting for too heavy a weight can 
 also mean you risk injury to your shoulders if your form gets sloppy as 
 a result of the load.Hold the dumbbells by your shoulders with your palms 
 facing forwards and your elbows out to the sides and bent at a 90° angle. 
 Without leaning back, extend through your elbows to press the weights above 
 your head. Then slowly return to the starting position.</p>

<h2 class="head1">2.Side Raise</h2>
<p class="para1">Stand or sit with a dumbbell in each hand at your sides. 
Keep your back straight, brace your core, and then slowly lift the weights
 out to the side until your arms are parallel with the floor, with the elbow
 slightly bent. Then lower them back down, again in measured fashion – you’ll
 find it all the harder if you avoid speeding up. A lot of people will cheat
 by “shrugging” the weights up using their traps. Resist the urge to do that
 by not raising your shoulder blades during the rep – instead focus on the 
 delts.</p>

<h2 class="head1">3.Front Raise</h2>
<p class="para1">Begin by holding both dumbbells of equal weight in front of
 your thighs with your palms facing your body (a pronated grip). Keeping your
 back straight and feet shoulder-width apart, lift the dumbbells in front of 
 you in a controlled manner until your hands are in line with your shoulders.
 Pause, then slowly lower back to the starting position.</p>
